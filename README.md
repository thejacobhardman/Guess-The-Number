# Guess-The-Number

This game utilizes a basic AI in order to provide a challenge for the user.

On Easy mode, the AI is basically brain dead and will continue to guess random numbers until the end of time.

On Medium Difficulty, the AI will learn from its own guesses but will ignore the player's guesses.

On Hard Difficulty, the AI will from its own guesses AND the player's guesses. This is about as close as you can come to playing against another human being.

Please feel free to mess with the code and add functions to the AI!
